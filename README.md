# Terrain Demo

> 20/10/2023

An experiment using Unity's terrain tool.

### Software Used

- Visual Studio Code 2023 (v1.85)
- Unity 2022.3.5f1 (LTS)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ManMetGames/TerrainDemo.git`
2.  Open the project in Unity
3.  Run the project

### Description

I made this demo during the third week of my master's degree in computer games development at Manchester Metropolitan University. It plays a cinematic of a camera pan around the island I made, before handing the controls to the player to explore the island. It took me approximately 6 hours to complete.

We were tasked with creating an island using the terrain tool and some assets we were given. We were then told to create a cinematic using an animation paired with the main camera.

From this project, I learned:
- How to use Unity's terrain tool
- How to use animations to create a cinematic
- How to switch cameras

### Controls

Press Space to skip the cinematic. Once you have control of the player, you can use WASD to move and Space to jump.
